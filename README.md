# Magnetic Quantum Models

This quantum theory model is a work of fiction, serving as a generic and abstract framework designed for the development of techniques in quantum theory. It does not primarily focus on aligning with existing theories.

However, discussions considering alignment and consistency with prevailing theories are highly encouraged and welcomed. Negative feedback and critical opinions are invaluable and considered of utmost importance for the further development and refinement of this theoretical model.

Please be open to discussion.
